##Node Express Webserver

This is a very basic webserver using Node and Express. The purpose of this is to quickly setup a server that can serve static pages for a website or web application.

###Setup

- Clone the repo
- Run ``` npm install ```. This will install all the node packages needed.
- Copy the static pages into the /app folder
- Make sure there is an index.html file in the /app folder
- Run ``` node server.js ```
